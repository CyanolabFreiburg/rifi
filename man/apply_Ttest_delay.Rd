\title{apply_Ttest_delay: is a statistical test to check the significance
of the point between 2 segments showing pausing site (ps) and
internal starting site (ITSS) independently.
apply_Ttest_delay uses t-test. The last point from the first segment
and the first point from the second segment are selected and added
to the residuals of each model. The sum is subjected to t-test.}
\usage{
apply_Ttest_delay(inp)
}
\arguments{
\item{inp}{SummarizedExperiment: the input data frame with correct format.}
}
\value{
the SummarizedExperiment with the columns regarding statistics:
\describe{
\item{ID:}{The bin/probe specific ID}
\item{position:}{The bin/probe specific position}
\item{delay:}{The delay value of the bin/probe}
\item{delay_fragment:}{The delay fragment the bin belongs to}
