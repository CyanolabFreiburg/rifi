	abstract = {An essential part of gene expression is the coordination of RNA synthesis and degradation, which occurs in the same cellular compartment in bacteria. Here, we report a genome-wide RNA degradation study in Escherichia coli using RNA-seq, and present evidence that the stereotypical exponential RNA decay curve obtained using initiation inhibitor, rifampicin, consists of two phases: residual RNA synthesis, a delay in the interruption of steady state that is dependent on distance relative to the mRNA's 5' end, and the exponential decay. This gives a more accurate RNA lifetime and RNA polymerase elongation rate simultaneously genome-wide. Transcripts typically have a single RNA decay constant along all positions, which is distinct between different operons, indicating that RNA stability is unlikely determined by local sequences. These measurements allowed us to establish a model for RNA processing involving co-transcriptional degradation, providing quantitative description of the macromolecular coordination in gene expression in bacteria on a system-wide level.},

	abstract = {Bacterial operons synchronize the expression of multiple genes by placing them under the control of a shared promoter. It was previously shown that polycistronic transcripts can undergo differential RNA decay, leaving some genes within the polycistron more stable than others, but the extent of regulation by differential mRNA decay or its evolutionary conservation remains unknown. Here, we find that a substantial fraction of E. coli genes display non-uniform mRNA stoichiometries despite being coded from the same operon. We further show that these altered operon stoichiometries are shaped post-transcriptionally by differential mRNA decay, which is regulated by RNA structures that protect specific regions in the transcript from degradation. These protective RNA structures are generally coded within the protein-coding regions of the regulated genes and are frequently evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, we provide evidence that differences in ribosome densities across polycistronic transcript segments, together with the conserved structural RNA elements, play a major role in the differential decay process. Our results highlight a major role for differential mRNA decay in shaping bacterial transcriptomes.},

	abstract = {Rifampicin (Rif) is one of the most potent and broad spectrum antibiotics against bacterial pathogens and is a key component of anti-tuberculosis therapy, stemming from its inhibition of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). We determined the crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNAP complexed with Rif. The inhibitor binds in a pocket of the RNAP beta subunit deep within the DNA/RNA channel, but more than 12 A away from the active site. The structure, combined with biochemical results, explains the effects of Rif on RNAP function and indicates that the inhibitor acts by directly blocking the path of the elongating RNA when the transcript becomes 2 to 3 nt in length.},

	abstract = {The term ‘transcriptional interference’ (TI) is widely used but poorly defined in the literature. There are a variety of methods by which one can interfere with the process or the product of transcription but the term TI usually refers to the direct negative impact of one transcriptional activity on a second transcriptional activity in cis. Two recent studies, one examining Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other Escherichia coli, clearly show TI at one promoter caused by the arrival of a transcribing complex initiating at a distant promoter. TI is potentially widespread throughout biology; therefore, it is timely to assess exactly its nature, significance and operative mechanisms. In this article, we will address the following questions: what is TI, how important and widespread is it, how does it work and where should we focus our future research efforts?},

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli gal operon has the structure Pgal-galE-galT-galK-galM. During early log growth, a gradient in gene expression, named type 2 polarity, is established, as follows: galE {\textgreater} galT {\textgreater} galK {\textgreater} galM. However, during late-log growth, type 1 polarity is established in which galK is greater than galT, as follows: galE {\textgreater} galK {\textgreater} galT {\textgreater} galM. We found that type 2 polarity occurs as a result of the down-regulation of galK, which is caused by two different molecular mechanisms: Spot 42-mediated degradation of the galK-specific mRNA, mK2, and Spot 42-mediated Rho-dependent transcription termination at the end of galT. Because the concentration of Spot 42 drops during the transition period of the polarity type switch, these results demonstrate that type 1 polarity is the result of alleviation of Spot 42-mediated galK down-regulation. Because the Spot 42-binding site overlaps with a putative Rho-binding site, a molecular mechanism is proposed to explain how Spot 42, possibly with Hfq, enhances Rho-mediated transcription termination at the end of galT.},
